# AFDX

## What is AFDX

AFDX® uses a special protocol to provide deterministic timing and redundancy management providing secure and reliable communications of critical and non-critical data.

AFDX® communication protocols have been derived from commercial standards (IEEE802.3 Ethernet MAC addressing, Internet Protocol IP, User Datagram UDP) to achieve the required deterministic behavior for avionics applications.  
End Systems (or LRU’s) based on Virtual Links (VL’s) communicate with Traffic Shaping by use of Bandwidth Allocation Gaps (BAGs).

AFDX® Switches incorporate functions for filtering and policing, switching (based on configuration tables), end-system and network monitoring.

## Main Feature

- AFDX® is based on IEEE 802.3 Standard (commercial Ethernet using Wire) with either 10Mbits/s or 100Mbits/s
- AFDX® uses a special Protocol to provide Deterministic Timing and Redundancy Management
- The main Elements of an AFDX® Network are:
  - AFDX® End Systems
  - AFDX® Switches
  - AFDX® Links

## AFDX® Network Topology Overview

- AFDX® is rather a Network than a Bus
- There are 2 Types of Devices on the Bus: Switches and End Systems
- All Connections are full-duplex 10Mbits/s or 100MBit/s (no dedicated backbone Bus for
- Inter-Switch Communication)
- Redundancy is achieved by Duplication of the Connections (Wires) and the Switches
- AFDX® uses special Extensions to provide deterministic Timing and Redundancy
- End Systems (E/S) exchange Frames through Virtual Links (VL)
- A VL defines the unidirectional Connection from 1 Source E/S to 1 or more Destination E/S(s)
- An E/S performs Traffic Policing, Integrity Checking and Redundancy Management on a VL Basis

## AFDX® Traffic Policing

- The E/S controls the Flow for each VL in accordance with the Bandwidth Allocation Gap (BAG)
- BAG Values are in ms: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
