Regading his appearance, he's got black hair and black eyes. and his nose shapes like arrow. He got a lot of weight for last 3 years. So I tease him that he looks like alomst 8 months pregant.

His insight and wise adivece have saved me from **making rash decisions more than a few times**. I am very **grateful for that**.
