I wanna talk about my friend whose name is Kyohoon. I met him when I was a freshman in university. We had outgoing personality so we easily became close friend with each other right after we met. It has been 15 yeas since we became friend.  
Regading his appearance, he's got black hair and black eyes. and his nose shapes like arrow. He got a lot of weight for last 3 years. So I tease him that he looks like alomst 8 months pregant.  
What I like the most about him is his calm nature. When he faces a problem, he usually steps back and tries to **think through first**. Sometimes he advises me when I am in trouble. His insight and wise adivece have saved me from **making rash decisions more than a few times**. I am very **grateful for that**.
