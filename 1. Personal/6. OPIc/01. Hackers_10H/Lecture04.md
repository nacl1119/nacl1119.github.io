## [**[8] Q10 (past tense routine)You indicated in the survey that you like to stay at home during your vacations. What kind of activities did you do during your last home vacation and when  was it? Describe what you did in detail.**](https://youtu.be/ZcGILR6X7y4)
My last **stay-at-home vacation was a couple of weeks ago**. It was a **week-long vacation**. Right before the vacation, I was really **tied up with work** so I desperately wanted to **kick back and relax**. Since I didn't want to anything productive, I first **slept in** till noon and became **a couch potato** for a few days. **I felt like a million dollars** while watching TV with beers.  
**Then** I met my friends to **catch up with each other**. We couldn't get together for a long time so we taled **for hours and hours**. **My friends are good listners and know every single thing about me so it was very comfortable sharing what happend**. Before the vacation, I was really **worn out** so I spent every second of my last vacation relaxing. To me, my last **stay-at-home** vacation was the best vacation ever!

## [**[9] Q11 These days, many people prefer to stay at home for vacations rather than going on a trip. What do you think the reasons are? Which one do you prefer and why? Please tell me in detail.**](https://youtu.be/ZcGILR6X7y4?t=4211)
These days, many people prefer to **stay at home during vacations** than **going on a trip**. I believe that **there are several reasons for their preference**. **To start with**, it's a busy life for everyone and people interact with other people 24/7 so they somethimes want to be alone and **collect their thoughts**. **It's good for a change of air** to stay at home. After resting for a few days, their worries are gone and they **feel refreshed**.  
What's more,the **rapid advances** in technology has allowed people to do various activities they couldn't do before. For example,they can search and download movies and TV shows online and watch them anytime they want. Being couch potato and **catching up on(with)** the TV programs are good ways to **let off some steam**.  
**I personally prefer** to stay at home during my vacation because I'm livig on a tight budget these days. **I am broke** so I've been **tightening my purse strings on every possible thing**. **I can't affot to** go abroad. But I believe what's really impornt is how they(I) spend their(my) vacation not where they(I) spend it!

## [**[10] Q12 Please explain how people usually spend their vactaions in your country. How did it change from the past to now? Are people vacationing in different ways? Compare how people in your country spent thier vacations in the past and how the ways have changed over the years.**](https://youtu.be/ZcGILR6X7y4?t=4828)
umm..This quiestion is very difficult but I will try my best to answer. I think people used to **spend their vacations** **according to** their personal preference. Some **went abroad** for travelling while others enjoyed a **homecations**. But **everything has totally changed** because of **the COVID-19** pandemic.  
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many people preferred to go abroad for travelling. **It was a trend** for many young Koreans an families as well. They were able to **try out** different culture, visit tourist's attractions and **widen** the viewpoint of the world through travelling.  
But after the COVID-19 pandemic, we can no longer travel abroad. **In fact**, we can barely **have gatherings** and eat out. So **without a choice**, people have to stay at home for(during) their vacation. I **personllay** think this is the biggest change **in how** poeple spend their vacations **from the past to now**.

## [TIP]
[1] If there is "usually" in the question, answer using present tense.  
[2] Seperate the topics in the answer. For example, in a trip question, it's better to talk about the preparation, activities, foods in the trip.
