### 시작
hi, I am the tenant living in Apartment 201.  
I am so sorry that I had many parties and couldn't control the amount of garbage I threw out.  
I really didn't **mean to cause** any trouble, and I want to **get along well with** you guys so I **came up with some solutions**.

### 과정
First, I will have fewer parties.  
I **threw a party** every single day!  
I will make sure to have a party **only** once a month.  
Another option I can think of is I will have parties outside!  
This way, I will be able to control the amout of garbage I produce and throw away less.  

### 결말
Which option do you prefer?  
Do you have another option in mind?  
Once again, I am really sorry for the trouble and to **make it up to you**, **I want to buy you dinner**.  
Shall we meet this Saturday?  
Okay then, I will see you on Saturday! Bye.
