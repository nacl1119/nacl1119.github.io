## [**[14] Q10 You indicated that you like to cook. What do you like to cook the most? Why do you like cooking that meal? How do you make it? How does it taste? Give me all the details.**](https://youtu.be/ZcGILR6X7y4?t=7349)

[TIP] 사물묘사, 사물 자체에 대한 묘사, 사물의 종류나 특징 어떻게 생겼는지, 왜 그것을 좋아하는지 등을 물어봄  
묘사를 하는 것은 **현재시제를** 사용해야한다.  
(요리설명)**My favorite dish to preapre** is(I like to cook) samgyetang. It's a chicken soup and considered a traditional Korean food.  
(특별한점)What's so special about this dish is that we cook a whole chicken without **cutting it up**. I like this dish because it's delicious(tasty) and it's **full of nutrients**.
(과정) First I need **to stuff the chicken with** sticky rice and ginseng. I need to put jujubes(배추) and garlic. I **boil it for about an hour** and it's done! You can season it with salt and pepper and eat the chicken with Kimchi.
