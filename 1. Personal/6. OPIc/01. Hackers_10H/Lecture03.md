When I **get there**, I **jog for an hour**. It helps me **feel refreshed** and then, I sit down on a bench and **admire the view**.  
**After that** I eat! At a convenience store, I can buy chicken, beer **and so on**! Having chicken and beer after jogging is **is a best thing to do**! I think jogging **is a great stress reliever**.

## **[8] Q10 (past tense routine)You indicated in the survey that you like to stay at home during your vacations. What kind of activities did you do during your last home vacation and when  was it? Describe what you did in detail.**
My last **stay-at-home vacation was a couple of weeks ago**. It was a **week-long vacation**. Right before the vacation, I was really **tied up with work** so I desperately wanted to **kick back and relax**. Since I didn't want to anything productive, I first **slept in** till noon and became **a couch potato** for a few days. **I felt like a million dollars** while watching TV with beers.  
**Then** I met my friends to **catch up with each other**. We couldn't get together for a long time so we taled **for hours and hours**. **My friends are good listners and know every single thing about me so it was very comfortable sharing what happend**. Before the vacation, I was really **worn out** so I spent every second of my last vacation relaxing. To me, my last **stay-at-home** vacation was the best vacation ever!

## **[9] Q11 These days, many people prefer to stay at home for vacations rather than going on a trip. What do you think the reasons are? Which one do you prefer and why? Please tell me in detail.**
These days, many people prefer to **stay at home during vacations** than **going on a trip**. I believe that **there are several reasons for their preference**. **To start with**, it's a busy life for everyone and people interact with other people 24/7 so they somethimes want to be alone and **collect their thoughts**. **It's good for a change of air** to stay at home. After resting for a few days, their worries are gone and they **feel refreshed**.  
What's more,the **rapid advances** in technology has allowed people to do various activities they couldn't do before. For example,they can search and download movies and TV shows online and watch them anytime they want. Being couch potato and **catching up on(with)** the TV programs are good ways to **let off some steam**.  
**I personally prefer** to stay at home during my vacation because I'm livig on a tight budget these days. **I am broke** so I've been **tightening my purse strings on every possible thing**. **I can't affot to** go abroad. But I believe what's really impornt is how they(I) spend their(my) vacation not where they(I) spend it!

## **[10] Q12 Please explain how people usually spend their vactaions in your country. How did it change from the past to now? Are people vacattioning in different ways? Compare how people in your country spent thier vacations in the past and how the ways have changed over the years.**
umm..This quiestion is very difficult but I will try my best to answer. I think people used to **spend their vacations** **according to** their personal preference. Some **went abroad** for travelling while others enjoyed a **homecations**. But **everything has totally changed** because of **the COVID-19** pandemic.  
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many people preferred to go abroad for travelling. **It was a trend** for many young Koreans an families as well. They were able to **try out** different culture, visit tourist's attractions and **widen** the viewpoint of the world through travelling.  
But after the COVID-19 pandemic, we can no longer travel abroad. **In fact**, we can barely **have gatherings** and eat out. So **without a choice**, people have to stay at home for(during) their vacation. I **personllay** think this is the biggest change **in how** poeple spend their vacations **from the past to now**.

## **[11]You indicated in the survey that you enjoy cycling. Compare the bike  you have right now with the one you had when you were young. How are they different? Tell me about it in as much detail as possible.**
**Well**... the bike I have right now is very different from my old bike. **To start with**, I used to have a 10 dollar bike when I was young. I got it **as a birthday gift** from my parents, and since I was very young, It had **training wheels**. It was very small and it broke easily.  
My current bike is **a lot** different **from** the old one. I ride **a road bike**. I had to work 5 months to pay 500 dollars for this bike. It was **way too expensive**, but I fell in love with its design **at first sight**, so I had no option. Of cource, it doesn't have training wheels as I am **a grown-up**, and there are many attatchments such as **lights for night riding** and **a water bottle holder**. **Oh, and**it has **a** strong body and never goes wrong. It's my **all-time favorite item** and I **adore it with my all heart**.

## **[12] Q11 (Past and Preset)Have you noticed any differences in the recycling system in your country? HOw has the process of recycling changed from the past? Please tell me in detail.**
Yes, Eva. There **have been a lot of changes in** recycling. **As far as I know**, the biggest change is what poeple **think of recycling**. **I mean**, in the past, people didnt' really care much about recycling. They just threw garbage away anywhere, **and at anytime** they wanted to.  
However, people have changed. Many people **have developed an interest in** recycling and try to **live in a green way** these days. **What's more**, the recycling system was **not as restrict as it is now.** The rules for recycling are much more complicated than in the past.
As far as I remember, people didn't have to **pay fines** for not recycling. But these days, we have **set days for recycling** and **specific sites** to throw **recyclables** away. If you fail to recycle, you have to pay a fine.  
Oh, and there are many more **recycling sites** now. You can easily find one **on every corner** of apartment complexes. **I personally think** these are the biggest(major) changes in recycling.

## **[13] Q12 (Social) How has the relationship between your country and neighboring countries changed? What is the reason for that change?**
(subject)  
Umm.. This is a difficult question. I haven't thought about it but I will try my best to answer. I would like to talk about the relationship between Korean and China. **There have been a lot of changes in** the relationship between the two countries.  
(past)
For example, in the past, **there was not much interaction** between the two counties. **Thus**, there were not many Chinese tourists in Korea. Oh, and as far as I know, Korean music was not popular in China.  
(present)  
**But nowadays**, Korean pop songs and singers are **all the rage(trend)** in China. As a result **there is more intraction** between the two countries. **I mean**, many Chinese tourists are visiting Korea and tourism industry is getting bigger day by day.  
(conclusion)  
I personally think that these is the biggest change in the relationshiop between Korea an China.

## [TIP]
[1] If there is "usually" in the question, answer using present tense.  
[2] Seperate the topics in the answer. For example, in a trip question, it's better to talk about the preparation, activities, foods in the trip.
