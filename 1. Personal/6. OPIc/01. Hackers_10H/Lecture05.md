## [**[11] Q10 You indicated in the survey that you enjoy cycling. Compare the bike you have right now with the one you had when you were young. How are they different? Tell me about it in as much detail as possible.**](https://youtu.be/ZcGILR6X7y4?t=5452)
**Well**... the bike I have right now is very different from my old bike. **To start with**, I used to have a 10 dollar bike when I was young. I got it **as a birthday gift** from my parents, and since I was very young, It had **training wheels**. It was very small and it broke easily.  
My current bike is **a lot** different **from** the old one. I ride **a road bike**. I had to work 5 months to pay 500 dollars for this bike. It was **way too expensive**, but I fell in love with its design **at first sight**, so I had no option. Of cource, it doesn't have training wheels as I am **a grown-up**, and there are many attatchments such as **lights for night riding** and **a water bottle holder**. **Oh, and**it has **a** strong body and never goes wrong. It's my **all-time favorite item** and I **adore it with my all heart**.

## [**[12] Q11 (Past and Present)Have you noticed any differences in the recycling system in your country? HOw has the process of recycling changed from the past? Please tell me in detail.**](https://youtu.be/ZcGILR6X7y4?t=6163)
Yes, Eva. There **have been a lot of changes in** recycling. **As far as I know**, the biggest change is what poeple **think of recycling**. **I mean**, in the past, people didnt' really care much about recycling. They just threw garbage away anywhere, **and at anytime** they wanted to.  
However, people have changed. Many people **have developed an interest in** recycling and try to **live in a green way** these days. **What's more**, the recycling system was **not as restrict as it is now.** The rules for recycling are much more complicated than in the past.
As far as I remember, people didn't have to **pay fines** for not recycling. But these days, we have **set days for recycling** and **specific sites** to throw **recyclables** away. If you fail to recycle, you have to pay a fine.  
Oh, and there are many more **recycling sites** now. You can easily find one **on every corner** of apartment complexes. **I personally think** these are the biggest(major) changes in recycling.

## [**[13] Q12 (Social) How has the relationship between your country and neighboring countries changed? What is the reason for that change?**](https://youtu.be/ZcGILR6X7y4?t=6767)
(subject)  
Umm.. This is a difficult question. I haven't thought about it but I will try my best to answer. I would like to talk about the relationship between Korean and China. **There have been a lot of changes in** the relationship between the two countries.  
(past)
For example, in the past, **there was not much interaction** between the two counties. **Thus**, there were not many Chinese tourists in Korea. Oh, and as far as I know, Korean music was not popular in China.  
(present)  
**But nowadays**, Korean pop songs and singers are **all the rage(trend)** in China. As a result **there is more intraction** between the two countries. **I mean**, many Chinese tourists are visiting Korea and tourism industry is getting bigger day by day.  
(conclusion)  
I personally think that these is the biggest change in the relationshiop between Korea an China.
