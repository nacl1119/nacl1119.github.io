I just moved in last week and I have some questions about recycling.  
### 과정
Where is the recycling site?  
I have been looking for it **for hours and hours** but couldn't find it.  
Oh, I see.. **I must have missed** it.  
When is the collection(recycling) day?  
Every Wednesday?  
I finish work really late on Wednesdays!  
Hmm... Oh, one more thing!  
Do I **get fined** if I don't do it right?  
Okay, I will make sure to do it right.  
### 결론
Thank you so much for your kind explanation. Bye.

### 시작
Hello. I just bought a T-shirt at your sore and T-shirt has a problem.  
(It has a stain on it.)  
### 과정
**I can think of several options.**  
First I can visit your store today and **get a full refund** or exchange it for a new one.  
But if it is sold out, you could give me store credit worth $50.  
That's how much I paid for the T-shirt.  
### 결말
(만능 마무리) **Which option do you prefer?**  
(만능 마무리) **Or do you have another option in mind?**  
Okay. So I will visit your store today.  
Thanks a lot. Bye.
