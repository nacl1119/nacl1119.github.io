## [**[1] Q10 You indicated in the survey that you like to go to a park. Compare the activities that children do at the park with the activities adults do at the park. How are they similar or different? Give as many details as possible.**](https://youtu.be/ZcGILR6X7y4?t=70) 
### 시작
umm.. wow, this question is really difficult 
and **I haven't thougt about it** but I will try my best to answer.  
### 과정
Both adults and kids really enjoy the beautiful view and fresh air at the park,  
but **I think there are so many diffences between** what kids and adults do at the park.  
**I mean**, adults including myself are tired **every single day** so we just want to **chill out**.  
Stuffs we do include **soaking up the sunlight**, having lunch by the water and of cource having chicken and beer. (It's the best combination right?)  
What kids do at the park are **totally different**.  
They are like little monsters!  
They **run around, play hide and seek** again and again!  
They never **get tired**!  
I sometiems want to have the energy that kids have!  
### 결론
**Anyways, I think these are the differences between** what kids and adults do at the park.

## [**[2] Q11 I would like to know about one of the issues parks are faced with. What is the biggest problem and what needs to be done to solve this problem? Tell me about it in detail.**](https://youtu.be/ZcGILR6X7y4?t=409)

### 시작
**I think one major issue we are facing right now is** COVID-19.  
We all know COVID-19 is a very serious pandaemic and **social distancing** is the key to prevent COVID-19.  

### 과정
So the **goverment has made some regulations on** the number of people gathering **at the same time**. But since it's not easy to monitor people 24/7, there are so many young people gathering **late at night(early in the morning)**. It's **overcrowded** and **it's obvious that** many people gathering at the same time is not helping the situation. I really want people to keep social distancing so that COVID-19 ends **in the near future**.
