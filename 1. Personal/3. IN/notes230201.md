# Roles and Responsibilities:  
•	Develop highly reliable software systems  
> what is reliable software systems  


•	Develop motor controller firmware architecture  
> I think that motor controller firmware architecture would have some interfaces with PWM(Pulse Width Modulation) and Sensor detector.

[I2C란?](https://mickael-k.tistory.com/184)  
> I2C, 아이 투 씨 라고 주로 하지만 사실 정식 명칭은 '아이 스퀘어 씨' 이다.  
Inter-Integrated Circuit(I2C)는 IC 사이 통신 링크를 제공하는 양방향 2와이어 직렬 버스 이다. 즉, 두가닥으로 직렬 통신을 하는 통신프로토콜 이다.
